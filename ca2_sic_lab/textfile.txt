A leader from Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has hit out at the BJP, shooting off a stinging letter to 
Union Home Minister Amit Shah, seeking permission to read the Hanuman Chalisa and Namaz outside Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 
residence. The stunt was an obvious reprisal for a similar threat by an MP-MLA couple in Maharashtra for Chief Minister 
Uddhav Thackeray over the weekend.

Fahmida Hassan Khan said she wanted to read the Namaz, Hanuman Chalisa, Durga Chalisa, Namokar Mantra
and more outside PM Modi's official residence at Delhi's Lok Kalyan Marg.
